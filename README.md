# JavaScript essentials in Node
---
Note 1:  Do an `npm install` to get the eleventy-fetch package installed.  This will be important for the `fetch-cache.js` examples.

Note 2: These are now in module type format, so you might see some updates to how the JSON is brought in through `import` instead of `require` in 'Common JS'.  That is a detail we don't need to worry about at the moment, but wanted to let you know.

Play and experiment with these examples.  These are designed to be run in node from the command line.

Create your own files and experiment until you get comfortable or at least more comfortable!

For example:
```
node hello.js
```

The order we covered in class was:

- hello
- arrays
- loops
- functions
- objects
- nobel

And new ones added are
- comparison-and-truth.js
- api.js
- fetch-cache.js
- unique.js
- filter.js
