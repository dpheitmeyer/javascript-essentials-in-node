# JavaScript essentials in Node

Play and experiment with these examples.  These are designed to be run in node from the command line.

Create your own files and experiment until you get comfortable or at least more comfortable!

For example:
```
node hello.js
```

The order we covered in class was:

- hello
- arrays
- loops
- functions
- objects
- nobel
